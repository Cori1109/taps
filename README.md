# TAPS (Tezos Automatic Payment System)

**TAPS** enables Tezos Bakers to automate rewards distribution with a web-page like interface.

It is written in CFML language (Coldfusion/Lucee). This repository contains all needed source code to run. However, there are some requirements.

## Getting started

To use this software you need to be a Tezos Baker with good experience. Follow the installation instructions below.
Two articles may be a good start:

## TAPS Installation

1) Download Lucee Server from [https://download.lucee.org/](https://download.lucee.org/)
2) Download H2 Database from Lucee Extensions [https://download.lucee.org/](https://download.lucee.org/)
3) Install Lucee.
   - Get root privileges for the download folder, click with right mouse button over Lucee icon and choose OPEN.
   - Go through Lucee setup wizard, maintaining default installation options.
   - Choose a password for Lucee administration and write it down in a piece of paper.
   - Configure Lucee to start at every boot.
   - DON'T install Apache connector. We will use Lucee only for localhost (not Internet).
   - After Lucee installation, test it in browser with: http://127.0.0.1:8888/

   You can start/stop Lucee Application Server with:
   
       sudo /opt/lucee/lucee_ctl [start] [stop]

4) Install H2 Database.
   - Copy the downloaded file /home/[user]/downloads/org.h2-1.3.172.lex to folder /opt/lucee/tomcat/lucee-server/deploy/
   - Wait a minute. Lucee detects the extension and installs it automatically. That's it!

5) On Command Line Interface, go to folder (CD): /opt/lucee/tomcat/webapps (Debian) or /opt/lucee/tomcat/webapps/ROOT (UBUNTU).

6) Install TAPS.

   - Clone TAPS from GitHub with: git clone https://github.com/TezosRio/taps.git
   - Start TAPS in your browser with http://127.0.0.1:8888/taps/index.cfm
   - Log in TAPS with default user/pass: admin/admin.
   
   Note: On (some) UBUNTU installations TAPS folder must be in /opt/lucee/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/
   
7) Usage.
   - Go to TAPS SETUP page and enter your Baker's details. TAPS starts in simulation mode,
     so, don't worry, any real transfers will be done.
        

## Upgrading TAPS

These step-by-step instructions should be followed if you already have Taps installed on your system and want to UPGRADE to a new version available at gitHub:

1) (Always!) Write down in a piece of paper your Taps Native Wallet mnemonic words and passphrase.

2) Stop Lucee server with the command: sudo /opt/lucee/lucee_ctl stop

3) Backup your current Taps folder (/opt/lucee/tomcat/webapps/taps or /opt/lucee/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/taps) to some directory outside Lucee directory tree (this way if things go wrong, you may undo).

4) Open a Terminal prompt and go to current Taps folder: cd /opt/lucee/tomcat/webapps/taps

5) Now we are going to update it from github repository with the commands:

   git fetch -all
   
   git reset -hard origin master
   
   
6) Start Lucee with the command:  sudo /opt/lucee/lucee_ctl start

7) Open Taps from your preferred browser with: http://127.0.0.1:8888/taps/index.cfm. It should now show the latest version.
