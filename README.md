# TAPS (Tezos Automatic Payment System)

**TAPS** enables Tezos Bakers to automate rewards distribution.

It is written in CFML language (Coldfusion/Lucee). This repository contains all needed source code to run. However, there are some requirements.

## Getting started

To use this software you need to be a Tezos Baker with good experience. Follow the installation instructions below.

## TAPS Installation

1) Download Lucee Server from [https://download.lucee.org/](https://download.lucee.org/)
2) Download H2 Database from Lucee Extensions [https://download.lucee.org/](https://download.lucee.org/)
3) Install Lucee.
   - Get root privileges for the download folder, click with right mouse button over Lucee icon and choose OPEN.
   - Go through Lucee setup wizard, maintaining default installation options.
   - Choose a password for Lucee administration and write it down in a piece of paper.
   - Configure Lucee to start at every boot.
   - DON'T install Apache connector. We will use Lucee only for localhost (not Internet).
   - After Lucee installation, test it in browser with: http://127.0.0.1:8888/

   You can start/stop Lucee Application Server with:
   
       sudo /opt/lucee/lucee_ctl [start] [stop]

4) Install H2 Database.
   - Copy the downloaded file /home/[user]/downloads/org.h2-1.3.172.lex to folder /opt/lucee/tomcat/lucee-server/deploy/
   - Wait a minute. Lucee detects the extension and installs it automatically. That's it!

5) Clone TAPS from GitHub with:

   git clone https://github.com/TezosRio/taps.git

6) Install TAPS.
   - Copy TAPS folder to /opt/lucee/tomcat/webapps/
   - Start TAPS in your browser with http://127.0.0.1:8888/taps/index.cfm
   - Log in TAPS with default user/pass: admin/admin.
   
7) Usage.
   - Go to TAPS SETUP page and enter your Baker's details. TAPS starts in simulation mode,
     so, don't worry, any real transfers will be done.
